# EcommerceWebsite
This is a basic e-commerce web application I created to practice full-stack development. 

The website includes:  User Authentication: Simple login and registration forms.  
Product Management: View and add products to the cart.  
Cart Functionality: Users can add items to their cart and view selected products.

Technologies Used:
Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: Spring Boot, Hibernate
This project helped me understand the integration of frontend and backend, user authentication, and basic e-commerce functionalities.
